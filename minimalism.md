All the things that I own at this point in time fall into at least one of these four categories.

1. Help me reach goals or aspirations (computer, camera)
2. Make my life simpler and safer (Water bottle, Telephone, multi-tool)
3. Help me express myself to others (clothes/accessories)
4. Provide or improve an experience (kindle, speakers/headphones)


Here is to a life, instead of bought, lived.
