take me on a journey, somewhere free
filled with people who embrace
each other and the other,
the happiness that is there,
and the future that they make
where the environment is force of creativity, and generosity
where the night is bright with beacons of individuality and the universe
where the day if full of knowledge and reflection
where our souls burn, as we burn our planet
