There is a balance to be made.

From the number of cocktails you drink to the love you choose to embrace.

The balance you find though, will always be unique to you.

This balance isn't a seesaw, it is an infinitely dimensional space with wants, needs, and moderation that breaths with each perspective you gain.

Gaining perspective doesn't always make it easier as it may add not only a new vector but also a new dimension which nothing can compare.

Sometimes a glimmer of balance can be found through.

You are rushed passed it as you have new experiences.

For me it feels unreachable. I am too scared to stop as I am afraid of missing this new perspective that I journey towards.

I have heard from others, when balance is found you will hit a wall. You will be dragged towards it and will do anything for it. All is fair they say.

I hope... I hope.
