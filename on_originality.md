On balance and originality  

I made a small game for psychonauts. This game consists of one task and two goals.  

task:  Create content that is as psychoactive as possible.  
goal:  Consumers must be unsure of whether you have ever taken psychedelics  
goal:  Consumers must be unsure of whether you created said content with the goal of it being psychoactive.  

The more psychoactive the content and the more unsure a consumer of said content is, the closer you are to mastering the game.

Creators who have failed at this game:  
Me  
The Beatles  
Radiohead  
Thom York  
Trent Renzor  
Every Jam Band ever known to man  
The writer of Inception, Ground hogs day, primer, and momento.  

Most creators don’t have to hide the fact that they have taken psychedelics. But I think there is something beautiful about hiding it.

IE, I am not sure if Neil DeGrasse Tyson have ever taken a psychedelic.

For those who don’t know who he is. He is an astronomer and Director of the Hayden Plantarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space and research associate in the department of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History. He is an amazing advocate for science and often has some interesting thoughts on religious experiences with stars and science.

This is one of my favorite quotes of all times that I use to ground/center myself when I get lost.

"the atoms of out bodies are traceable to stars that manufactured them in their cores and exploded these enriched ingredients across our galaxy, billions of years ago. For this reason, we are biologically connected to every other living thing in the world. We are chemically connected to all molecules on Earth. And we are atomically connected to all atoms in the universe. We are not figuratively, but literally stardust." -Neil de Grasse Tyson

This quote perfectly explains how I feel about this universe and why we are all connected without the fluff of spirituality.

I think about why I love this statement a lot and I think today I can finally put it into words. It is truly an original way to view the world. More beautiful than any other art that I can imagine.

I believe that the appeal of beauty comes from easy to comprehend original views the world. I think this is what makes humor, well humorous. Or what makes music, so beautiful. Or what makes usain bolt’s 9.58 100m sprint astounding; we as humans can do that.

Which is why we have a generic, but not specific, distaste of things that are tacky, kitsch, or cliche. These describe things that are not only not original, but over done. By making it so obvious it implies ignorance of the consumer.

I think this may explain my apathy for most visionary art. I feel that so much of it is pandering to be psychoactive and is so obviously psychoactive. It is so much simpler to make what people want than it is to revolutionize and create something new. There is some visionary art out there that is truly amazing in its own right. But so much of it is just small iterations on previous ideas that lack individuality. I am not saying that people should stop making that art or pandering art in general as it still makes you and/or other people happy. But I find more beauty in greater originality. (It also loses the game in the beginning by quite a bit.)
