I made the pendant to represent what I thought was an important idea.

The triangle in the center is the greek letter delta. The greek letter delta in math and science is used as a constant to represent change.

The pendant is a circle to represent life. Like the circle of life in the lion king, or the zen Ensō.

Together they represent "Life is Change" or "Change is life's only constant". This is an important idea to me because when life sucks, we change it till it doesn't and when it doesn't suck we appreciate the now cause eventually it will.

As simple of a concept this is, it isn't easy to embrace. Making change is hard as well as embracing the now. So to help you with that I would like to ask you 3 and a half questions. I don't want to tell me the answer cause, first I don't care, second I want you to be honest with the answer and the only way to do that is to keep it to yourself.

1) If you could change one thing about your life or your self right now, what would it be?

You probably have feelings when you answered this first question.
Feelings are important, they are telling you where you need to move from or where you need to move towards. Feelings are the compass that you follow on your journey of life. To ignore those feelings is to give up agency and power.
If you can’t sit with this feeling then you won’t be able to make the change.
If the feeling is unpleasant that is okay, unpleasant is power, it is telling you where you need to move from, it is the motivation to make that change.

2) Now that you know what you want to change. What is preventing you from making that change right now this second?

You probably also have feelings when you answered this second question.
The feelings here are like the ying to the yang of the feelings of the first question. Together they make your complete compass, your desire mixed with your opposition.
Sit with these feelings for a moment now, sit with them without judgement and if you can radically accept them as the truth, neither bad nor good, just are.

3) Now that you know what you want to change and what is preventing you. Change doesn’t happen without action. What are you going to do? What is the smallest thing that you can do that can take you towards your goal?

If you don’t know the answer it probably means that you need to learn more, either about your feelings or about the thing you want to more towards and that is probably the next step.

3.5) Now that you know what you do, go one step smaller. You didn’t go small enough. What is the next smallest thing that you can do to take you towards that step that you just wanted to make? And keep on figuring out what the previous step is till it is so small it is embarrassing that you can’t do it. To the point where the only thing that is preventing you is sitting with your feelings.


Telling someone else the answers to these questions will be like releasing the pressure valve. Nobody else knowing of the change you want will ever make that change happen for you. So keep these answers to your self unless you are asking for help for a specific step. It is rare that we can ever make change by ourselves.

So I give this pendant to you to not only remind you of this ritual and the steps that you are going to take but remind you of the feeling because the hardest part of change is remembering that you want it.
