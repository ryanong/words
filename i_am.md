I am not your anime protagonist,

I am more than your asian stereotype.

I am the skin you see but not the stories you hear.

I am american, where ethnicity should not define.

I am a new yorker, where "white" is not the majority.

I am human, because color doesn't matter.

I question, because the answer always changes.

I adventure, because the future is infinite.

I am open, because others are scared.

I am kind, because some are selfish.

I care, because many are oblivious.
