I take a different mental path every time I walk home. Thinking about the future, the past, the present, my career, my friends, my hopes, my fears. The one I dread the most though is the path of my loneliness. I steer clear of it as much as possible with music, or alcohol. Sometimes though it is the only path you can take. Music won't take me off the path at this point, but it can be my lighted guide. Alcohol would just make it worse. I think the path can be taken with friends but only if I'm stuck do I seek their help. This path will always be there in some form or another. Being able to walk it alone only makes me stronger. Through this path I find old thoughts and perspectives scattered. Old relationships, special moments, regrets, and temptations. Temptations to run away from this path. Pretend it never happened. Look for the easy solution instead of the best solution. To drink my self into a stupor or trip myself into a fake realization.... Instead I take the scattered memories as clues to help me finish this path. They are far from random. There is something linking them and for me, that is usually the key.

I'm still walking the path this morning but at least I can ask friends to walk with me.

I share this because not everything is always perfect. We should share vulnerable moments as well as our happy ones so we can support and learn from each other. We are all human, I am not enlightened, I am just another traveller.
