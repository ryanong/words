I have art in a safe I can never open.

Rarely do we know the cost of things we want. I dreamed of traveling
the world and becoming wise. I figured it had to be done alone. I
gained wisdom along with a jaded lonely soul. What value is there in
an experienced unshared? Is it any different than a lie you tell to
others and yourself? Few will understand you as they must reverse
engineer the experience from your stories. Some may have something
similar. I have met travelers who love owning an experience and having
it for themselves. To me this feels like art in a safe. Something that
you use to hold over others and feel special. As much as I love being
unique if it isn't something that others can appreciate then it isn't
valuable.
