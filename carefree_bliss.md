Cold souls, warm bodies.
Minds lost in vanity among the builds and the drops.
Dancing for others and not for the self.
The thought of being seen more erotic than love it self.
Drunken thoughts of glamour and magnificence among the normal and the average.
Judgmental glares of true passion.
Carefree bliss for the possessed.

Little did I know the importance of being seen.
It is only when you see yourself do you truly see others.
