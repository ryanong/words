I met a man from the west coast yesterday at the airport bar. His name was earnest and was visiting his daughter and grand daughter in Italy. It was his first time flying and he wasn't sure how he felt about it yet. He was a trucker for 13 years he said, he is a land lover for the most part. He also owned a company for a while till his brother-in-law ran it into the ground, hitchhiked around the US in the 70s, married 3 times. I asked if had any wisdom for a young 25 year old. He said, stay single. I laughed. He said seriously, stay independent. He lost himself in his partners and that is when it went wrong with all of them. "Throw yourself into love, but don't get lost... don't get lost."
