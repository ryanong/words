I have issues with the word unconditional, I forget the word exists all the time. Everything has conditions, unconditional feels like hyperbole, they don't understand what they are saying. unconditional, unconditional, unconditional, the more I say it the more it makes me feel. I squirm, it makes my chest feel weird. unconditional. unconditional, the more I type it the more I feel it. unconditional, unconditional. Maybe it is the word that goes with it that I am afraid of. that is quite the weighty promise that I don't think most can keep.
