A restless soul among infinite dreams.  
Our opportunities rarely sync.  
We struggle... I struggle for what is supposed to be.  
But so little of the dream is there.  
I would not call this failure or hopeless.  
Just a postponed reality. Hope and effort is what drives us. And this dream will become reality with enough effort and imagination.
