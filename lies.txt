Lies are told by the eyes of the wanderer. They fill the holes of those who are lost with stories that are deeper than the truth. We see what makes everybody similar and what everybody wants. To be important. I tell them they are unique because I have traveled the world and met many people. I never lie. But as I said earlier we are also mostly the same. We are all still human, we are all still animals. People are easy to fool. Especially ourselves.

(Illusions of importance. I am only human.)
